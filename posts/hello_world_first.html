                <p>by <a href="https://x.com/SoraSue77">Sora Suegami</a>, <a href="https://x.com/backaes">Enrico
                        Bottazzi</a>, <a href="https://x.com/0xpiapark">Pia Park</a>
                </p>
                <p>Today, we’re excited to announce that <strong>we have successfully implemented <a
                            href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/236">Diamond iO</a></strong>, a straightforward
                    construction of indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) that we published in February, and
                    <strong>completed its end-to-end workflow</strong>. You can explore the codebase <a
                        href="https://github.com/MachinaIO/diamond-io">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>The current implementation includes minor differences from the theoretical construction and supports
                    a limited range of circuit functionalities. Nonetheless, it demonstrates the concrete efficiency of
                    the novel techniques introduced in Diamond iO, <strong>opening a new path toward practical
                        iO</strong>.</p>
                <h2>iO is powerful, but far from practical use</h2>
                <p>While technological acceleration is increasingly driven by data-centric algorithms operating on vast
                    datasets controlled by centralized entities, there is an observable decline in individuals' control
                    over personal data. </p>
                <p>We believe that a <strong>global private computation platform</strong> represents the only viable
                    bridge to reconcile and further boost tech acceleration and personal data sovereignty. As the value
                    of private information delegated to such a platform grows, it becomes necessary to rely on a
                    security foundation that can scale regardless of the stakes involved. </p>
                <p>Unlike other technologies such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC) or Multi-Party Fully Homomorphic
                    Encryption (MP-FHE), facing <a
                        href="https://mirror.xyz/privacy-scaling-explorations.eth/nXUhkZ84ckZi_5mYRFCCKgkLVFAmM2ECdEFCQul2jPs">privacy
                        scalability issues</a>, iO completely removes the perpetual reliance on committees after
                    distributed trusted setup processes. In other words, iO unlocks a programable protocol that acts as
                    the <strong>perfect trustless third party</strong>, relying solely on cryptographic hardness
                    assumptions to guarantee the security of any secrets—akin to Nick Szabo's definition of <a
                        href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/the-god-protocols/">God Protocol</a>.</p>
                <p>Following a series of studies on iO, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3406325.3451093">a
                        breakthrough work by Aayush Jain, Huijia Lin, and Amit Sahai in 2020</a> demonstrated that iO
                    could be constructed solely from standard assumptions, firmly established through over a decade of
                    research. However, iO has been seen as a theoretical cryptographic primitive because of the
                    complexity of its constructions. In fact, <a
                        href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15618-7_12">one of the most recent
                        studies on the iO implementation</a> reports a simulation result that obfuscating a 2-bit
                    multiplication circuit requires around 10^27 years and 20 Zetta bytes of memory.</p>
